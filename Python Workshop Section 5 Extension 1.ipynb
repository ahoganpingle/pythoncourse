These act just like mathematical functions, in that they accept arguments, process them, and return something else.

    "A few statements regarding something called *scope* are in order. The scope is the region of the code where a variable is defined.  Take a look at the cell with the function `squareit`.  The first line that is executed is line 6, in which `x` is defined as 2. This is passed into function `squareit`, which defines a new variable (purposefully!) also called `x`, which is the square of the variable that was passed in.  This is returned, and printed. The returned value is 4, and the final `print x` line indicates that at this point `x` is 2. So, it is clear that, although we are defining a variable called `x` in the function `squareit`, this value is *not* retained when execution returns out of the function, and `x` is back to the value we defined it as on line 6.  Hence the scope of the `x` in the function `squareit` is only that function - not outside of it.\n",

Because in principle, we could be calling the function from code written in a different file, where `x` would not automatically be available in the function.

    "One further thing needs to be mentioned regarding arguments. The thing that gets passed into the function is a reference to the Python object, not the identifier (remember that we showed above that the identifier is separate to the object held in the computer's memory). This becomes important when we pass lists, or any mutable object, as arguments to functions (in our previous example the passed variables were immutable).  Have a look at the following:"
