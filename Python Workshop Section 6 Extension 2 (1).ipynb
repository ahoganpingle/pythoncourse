    "    <p>This is where you start to develop the skills that let you quickly and efficiently manipulate and visualise large batches of numbers.  This has many applications in both the corporate workplace and science. Increasingly, large volumes of data are driving the way companies devise strategies to give them the edge.  So knowing how to deal efficiently and quickly with large arrays is important.  Data scientists need to use numerical packages like Numpy to process and interrogate large amounts of data. Scientists use Numpy to run computer models and analyse data.  Wherever there are large bunches of numbers to crunch, a numerical package like Numpy is the tool of choice, since it provides access to C-like speed but with Python-like ease of use. </p>\n",

    "As we have seen, we can use the built-in Python objects to perform repetative operations.  However, we have used relatively small numbers of objects, and if we were to increase the numbers of iterations, we would quickly find that the time taken to perform these operations in Python is not negligible.  We also found that to make changes to a list (e.g. to square it) we had to manually tell the computer to loop over the whole array, which itself becomes somewhat repetitive after a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where Numpy comes in. Numpy stands for *Num*erical *Py*thon, and it cures both these problems.  It provides its own type, called an `NDArray`, which allows fast and easy operations on whole arrays at once. The key difference between Numpy's `NDArray`s and Python's lists is that all the elements in an `NDArray` are forced to be the same type of object, be it `int`s, `float`s or whatever.  Numpy's core code is written in C, and all the looping is done in that language, behind the scenes, with much less overhead than looping in Python.  The result is that, while the results are not *quite* as fast as pure C execution, the speed hit is probably much less than the gain in time created by the ease of use of Numpy relative to C.\n",

    "This is the standard way of importing Numpy.  What do we mean by \"import\"?  Importing is one of the strengths of Python.  It allows an easy way to effectively 'copy-and-paste' a bundle of code (called a *module*, discussed later) into your program, and at the same time provides its own namespace.  This means that any variable or function associated with Numpy is accessed via `numpy.<something>`, and it is very clear what functions and variables belong to which bits of code.  This saves a lot of hassle!  In our example above, we have imported Numpy, and changed the name of the namespace to `np`, which saves a bit of typing and, as indicated, is now conventional practice.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is another way of importing modules, in which all of the objects in the module are dumped directly into your `__main__` namespace, thereby eliminating the need to write e.g. `\"np.\"` before each function in that module.  This syntax is, using our Numpy example, \n",

    "from pylab import *\n",

There is no doubt that this saves on typing, and if you are familiar with these modules then you can generally avoid the problems that come with loading up your `__main__` namespace, e.g. overwriting object identifiers.  However, at this stage, we will stick to the \"best practice\" approach and use the standard, separate namespaces for all these modules. \n",
