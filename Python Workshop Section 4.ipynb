    "<p>While indentation is a common convention when programming in any language, in Python this is actually forced - it is built into the languge as the way that the code blocks are defined. It is not optional! This makes for very clean-looking code compared to other languages that have IF...ENDIF, FOR...ENDFOR statements or braces '{}' surrounding the code blocks. On the other hand, it can be irritating if you are using a text editor that does not automatically indent the cursor for you when you press return. Pick your text editors wisely! It is conventional to use 4 spaces as each 'unit' of indentation - not tabs.</p>\n",
