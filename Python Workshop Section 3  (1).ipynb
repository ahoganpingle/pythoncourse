    "\n",
    "Crunching numbers generally requires doing calculations on bunches of values, and it is often useful to be able to collect numbers together in a single container.  However, Python allows more than simple numbers to be bunched together; it possesses a variety of so-called *container objects* or *sequences* (sometimes also called *iterables* depending on the context) that allow different data types to be lumped together in different ways.  We have met one of these already: the `string` type above, in which we saw that we could access part of each string by following the variable name with some numbers enclosed within square brackets.  Other container objects are *lists*, *tuples*, and *dictionaries*. Let's take a look at this further...  \n",

Likewise, `polly[3:12]` begins at index 3 (`'i'`) and finished at index 12 - 1 = 11 (`'t'`).  If no second index is given, it is assumed that the range continues to the end of the list, and likewise if no first index is given, it is assumed that the range begins at the start.  Values at the end of the list can be accessed easily by counting down from the last value at index -1, such that `polly[0:-4]` starts at the beginning, and finishes at index -4 - 1 = -5, i.e. the fifth letter from the end (`'o'`).  A third colon delimits the step, such that e.g. a value of 2 means \"take every second letter\". Hence, polly[3:10:2] means \"start at index 3 and take every other letter until you get to index 9\", returning the 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th values (`'igfr'`).

In our example, above, the first three objects (4 , 'not', and 2) are inserted with no format specifiers, so take the default for their type and value.
